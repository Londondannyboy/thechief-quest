# TheChief.quest - Continuation Prompt

## Quick Start Prompt (Copy this entire section):

```
I'm working on TheChief.quest, a live Chief of Staff careers website. The MVP is complete and live at https://thechief.quest with 58+ pages indexed by Google.

Project location: /Users/dankeegan/thechief-quest

Current status:
- Site is LIVE at thechief.quest (Vercel hosting)
- 58+ content pages created in Sanity CMS
- Google has successfully fetched sitemap
- All TypeScript/build errors fixed
- GitHub Actions automation set up

Tech stack:
- Next.js 15.5.2 + TypeScript
- Sanity CMS (project ID: al3tn61d)
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel deployment
- GitHub: Londondannyboy/thechief-quest

Key files to check:
- /PROJECT_STATUS.md - Full status and next steps
- /CLAUDE.md - Project overview
- /.env.local - API keys (Sanity tokens already configured)

Next priorities:
1. Add Google Analytics (need GA4 ID)
2. Create more location×industry pages (90+ remaining)
3. Implement job board with real listings
4. Add email capture/newsletter
5. Create blog section for SEO

Please read PROJECT_STATUS.md first to understand the current state, then help me with the next phase of development.
```

## Alternative Detailed Prompt (if you need more context):

```
I'm continuing work on TheChief.quest at /Users/dankeegan/thechief-quest. This is a Chief of Staff careers platform that's now live and being indexed by Google.

COMPLETED:
✅ Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Sanity CMS setup
✅ 58+ SEO-optimized pages (20 locations, 6 industries, 30 combinations)
✅ Custom domain (thechief.quest) live on Vercel
✅ Google Search Console sitemap submitted and fetched
✅ All build errors fixed with GitHub Actions automation
✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

ENVIRONMENT:
- Sanity Project ID: al3tn61d
- Sanity tokens configured in .env.local and Vercel
- GitHub repo: Londondannyboy/thechief-quest
- Auto-deploy: GitHub → Vercel pipeline active

NEXT PHASE (Growth):
The MVP is complete. Now I need to:
1. Add Google Analytics tracking (I'll provide GA4 ID)
2. Generate remaining 90 location×industry combination pages
3. Build functional job board (schema exists, needs UI)
4. Implement email capture and newsletter signup
5. Add blog section for content marketing
6. Create interactive salary calculator
7. Implement site search

Please start by:
1. Reading /PROJECT_STATUS.md for complete context
2. Checking /CLAUDE.md for requirements
3. Running `npm run dev` to start local development
4. Helping me tackle the next priority items

All API keys are in .env.local. Sanity Studio is at /studio. The site builds and deploys automatically on git push.
```
